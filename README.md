# Optimization & Simulation

## Genetic Algorithm
We will implement Genetic algorithm using the following problem statement and Data. Genetic algorithm involves three main steps

- Building the initial population also called as set of chromosomes

- Formulating fitness function for evaluation.

- Reproduction using mutation or crossover(single -point splicing or multi point splicing) 

The code clearly shows all the steps anf the final model built with the help of individual helper functions.

### Problem Statement: 

You are going to spend a month in the wilderness. You're taking a backpack with you, however, the maximum weight it can carry is 80 kilograms. You have a number of survivalitems available, each with its own number of "survival points".Your objective is to maximize the number of survivalpoints while selecting the items. Use genetic algorithm to solve this.
#### Data:
Items: "pocketknife", "beans", "potatoes", "onions", "phone", "lemons", "sleeping bag",
"rope", "compass", "umbrella", "sweater", "medicines", "others"

Survival Points: 15, 16, 13, 14, 20, 12, 17, 18, 17, 19, 10, 12, 11 in the respective order

Weights: 5, 6, 3, 4, 11, 2, 7, 8, 10, 9, 1, 12, 11 in the respective order
